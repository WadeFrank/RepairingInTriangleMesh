This code uses some functions from the manopt toolbox (http://www.manopt.org). For the ease of the user, we have incorporated the required functions from manopt into the package. As such, there is no need to install 
the manopt toolbox. However, appropriate citation to the manopt toolbox is encouraged.

To execute the code, run the runme.m file. The toy data contains training and test data for a multiclass problem. The covariance descriptors contain 10 genuine features and 20 noisy
features. Properly reducing the dimensionality will result in covariance descriptors with less noisy features and hence increases the classification accuracy.
